One of the channels I follow on YouTube is called Numberphile, and they give plenty of good ideas for mathematical games.  In this game the user has to move pieces around a chessboard in order to liberate "clones" from a prison. On Numberphile, they suggested playing this game using an actual chessboard, but I decided that a better way to do it would be to write my own game.  So here it is.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The user interacts by clicking on the clones it wants to move around.  In addition to this the user can create their own puzzles.  Since I had already developed a lot with the canvas, this was simply a matter of using existing experience to make a game.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<dt><em>Challenge</em>: Making the weights.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: Ideally the weights of the squares should be displayed when requested.  In Firefox this worked fine, but not in Chrome.  The reason for this is that I wanted to make a fraction line with a length proportional to the number of digits in th denominator.  This meant I had to use a <code>log10</code> function, but his does not exist in Chrome.  After much debugging I found the problem and fixed it.  This one bug prevented me from sending this page to Numberphile within a few days of making the game. (Resolved)</dd>
